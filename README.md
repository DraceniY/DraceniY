### Hi there 👋

I'm Yasmine, Data Scientist consultant who worked in academia and industry sectors. I'm Passionate about Science, Education, Climate Action and Sustainability. I love exploring data and discovering meaningful patterns 🕵🏼‍♀️. As well as bridging the gaps between technicals aspects and break it down for a general audience.

Collaboration is at the heart of my approach. I enjoy working alongside diverse teams to solve intricate problems, but I also have a proven track record of fostering effective teamwork and serving as a trusted partner. As a natural leader, I have developed valuable leadership skills through various experiences. My ability to effectively communicate and foster teamwork enables me to guide projects towards successful outcomes.

Some of my projects in teaching are available in this GitHub as well as side projects in Statistics/Data Visualization Sustainability, Bioinformatics and so long.
